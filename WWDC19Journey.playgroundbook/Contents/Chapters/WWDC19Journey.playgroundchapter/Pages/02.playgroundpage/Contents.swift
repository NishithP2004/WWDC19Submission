 # To WWDC and beyond!
 
 # GOAL: Get to the McEnery Convention Center
 
 Welcome to San Francisco International Airport. Let's head to the WWDC venue. As we walk through the bustling Silicon Valley we see multiple landmarks enroute to the convention center.
 Take a look at the wonderous Golden Gate Bridge! A marvel built from 1933-1937 still stands as the defining landmark of San Fransisco and possibly the whole of California. On the other corner in Cupertino we have Apple Park as well. This is Apple's new headquarters which is occupied by over 2,000 employees.
